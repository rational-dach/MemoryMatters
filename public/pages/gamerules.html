			Game Rules for MemoryMatters</h1>
		<h2>
			History</h2>
		<p>
			MemoryMatters is based on the original card game Memory. The origins of the game of memory are lost in the mist of times. Not even wikipedia knows!</p>
		<h2>
			Goal of the Game</h2>
		<p>
			In Memory each player tries unveiling more pairs of matching cards than the opponent.</p>
		<h2>
			Game Start</h2>
		<p>
			At the start of the game 8 matching pairs of cards are randomly shuffled and set face down in a 4 x 4 pattern. A starting player is randomly determined to begin the first turn.</p>
		<h2>
			Game Turns</h2>
		<p>
			Each turn starts with all remaining cards placed face down. A turn consists if clicking on a face down card to reveal its picture, then choosing another face down card. If the two pictures match, the cards remain open and the player whose turn it is scores a point. When the player scores a point he or she immediately gets another turn. If this was the last pair of cards to be unveiled the game ends.</p>
		<p>
			If the two pictures unveiled do not match, both players may look at the two open cards and memorize their position. The cards are then turned face down again and the other player takes his or her turn.</p>
		<h2>
			Victory</h2>
		<p>
			When the last pair of cards has been unveiled, each player counts score. The player with the highest number of points wins the game.</p>
